# Tip calculator - Frontend Mentor Project

![Final design of the challenge](./design/CustomPercent.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## Where to find everything

Inside the `/design` folder you will find the wireframe. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

## I did more!

I include a final bill that contains the value of bill + tip.
